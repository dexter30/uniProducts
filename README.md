# uniProducts
This is where I dump first Renderer. This is using SDL commands to render a full 3D object and structures I made to scale, move and rotate. 

All I use SDL for is to place a pixel at a certain position and then i use my own structures to manipulate its position.

INSTRUCTIONS

Press "space" to make the object bigger and b to shrink the object

Press left, right, up and down to move the object and E and Q to rotate

My written CPP files:

uniProducts/sdlgame/
freading.cpp // This is the cpp filer i made to read obj files
main.cpp // I put my code to display 3D images in main 

This was my first program so there are a lot of issues and it doesn't even compile or run portably.


todo: include make a portable executable
